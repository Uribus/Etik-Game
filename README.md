# Etik-Game
Trivia-like game about Ethics, Legistation and Profession. It has some dependencies specified on the rules and is designed to be played with a board, chips and a dice. The answers are thought to be provided orally, and other
specific game properties are supposed to be settled by the players while at the start of the game, such as time for each question, time for debates...
The main goal of this game is to learn and check the knowledege acquired during the course. Let's dive into it.

## Topics
The cards are about 5 different topics: Gender Gap, Data Privacy, Data Protection laws and rules, Free Software and Facts about ethics in Computer Science. Each topic has questions around what 
it was covered during the lectures so you are free (I encourage you) to include new ones with different, more specific or more generic questions.
